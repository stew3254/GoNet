Data Source:
  Potential IO sources to be parsed. Can be 1 directional or bidirectional

  List of clauses:
    Can only get input from:
      stdin
    Can only send output to:
      stdout
      stderr
    Birectional:
      tcp-listen:<ADDRESS>:<PORT> # Note if address is left blank, 0.0.0.0 will be assumed
      tcp-connect:<ADDRESS>:<PORT> # Address cannot be left blank
      udp-listen:<ADDRESS>:<PORT> # Note if address is left blank, 0.0.0.0 will be assumed
      udp-connect:<ADDRESS>:<PORT> # Address cannot be left blank
      file:<NAME>
      command:<NAME> # Will worry about this later

Labels:
  Used to give a more convenient label to data sources

  Syntax:
    <label> <data source>

  Examples:
    in stdin # This maps the word in to stdin
    out stdout # This maps the word out to stdout

Pipes:
  Pipes are used to transmit from one data source to another. This can use raw sources, or label names mapped to sources. Pipes can be chained to link multiple clauses together

  Syntax:
  <data source> -> <data source>

  Examples:
  in stdin
  in -> stdout

  l tcp-listen:0.0.0.0:1234
  stdin -> l -> stdout
